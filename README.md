# Awesome Tech Communities

This is a list of tech communities, on Slack, Discord, Meetup, or elsewhere.

Please feel free to submit a Pull Request (or an Issue) to add a new community, information about an existing community, or to indicate a community becoming active or inactive.

Many of these communities were found on other lists but are apparently inaccessible or inactive. However, any of them may still be present or active in places or ways I am unaware of, so I am still presenting them here.

Links for communities below [Regional](#regional) (i.e., those starting with [Conferences](#conferences-public-communities)) were copied over from elsewhere, but have not yet been checked for the communities being current.

> [!TIP]
> If you hover over an ⓘ next to a link for a second, it will present a tooltip containing information about that link.
